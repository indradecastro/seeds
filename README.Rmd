This repo contains a silly shiny-app to interactively explore the emergence of seedlings in a microcosm experiment.
To run the app just run the following code in R:

> install.packages("shiny")  
library(shiny)  
runGitHub("repo", "indradecastro")

The app allow the user to choose the seed species ("Hordeum", "Anthyllis", "Cistus", "other") and view several plots showing seedling emergence grouped by several factors:

- histogram showing frecuency of seedlings per microcosm
- seedling emergence by traditional groups of scarabs (endocoprid, paracoprid, telecoprid and 3 control treatments)
- seedling emergence by treatment: control (x3) vs scarabs (x10 species)
